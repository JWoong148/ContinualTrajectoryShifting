## Abstract

Meta-learning of shared initialization parameters has shown to be highly effective in solving few-shot learning tasks. However, extending the framework to many-shot scenarios, which may further enhance its practicality, has been relatively overlooked due to the technical difficulties of meta-learning over long chains of inner-gradient steps. In this paper, we first show that allowing the meta-learners to take a larger number of inner gradient steps better captures the structure of heterogeneous and large-scale task distributions, thus results in obtaining better initialization points. Further, in order to increase the frequency of meta-updates even with the excessively long inner-optimization trajectories, we propose to estimate the required shift of the task-specific parameters with respect to the change of the initialization parameters. By doing so, we can arbitrarily increase the frequency of meta-updates and thus greatly improve the meta-level convergence as well as the quality of the learned initializations. We validate our method on a heterogeneous set of large-scale tasks, and show that the algorithm largely outperforms the previous first-order meta-learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and convergence, as well as multi-task learning and fine-tuning baselines.

### Contribution of this work

- We show that large-scale meta-learning requires substantially a larger number of inner gradient steps than what are reqruied for few-shot learning.
- We show that gradually extending the length of inner learning trajectories lowers the risk of converging to poor meta-level local optima.
- To this end, we propose a novel and an efficient algorithm for large-scale meta-learning that frequently performs meta-optimization even with excessively long inner-learning trajectories.
- We verify our algorithm on a heterogeneous set of tasks, on which it achieves significant improvements over existing meta-learning algorithms in terms of meta-convergence and generalization performance.
